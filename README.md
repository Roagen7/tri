# A simple 3d engine built using OpenGL
See [examples](examples) for example usage.

Core features: 
1. creating meshes/models
2. loading meshes from wavefront .obj files
3. multiple ambient/point/directional lights using PHONG + bloom
4. skyboxes
5. materials
6. camera
7. dynamic shader library (to avoid ubershader approach)
8. viewport postprocessing (filters, grayscale etc.)

For now the engine comes as a standalone library (tricore and triutils).
